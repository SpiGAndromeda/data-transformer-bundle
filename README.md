## How to install the bundle?
The package can be installed via Composer:
```bash
composer require it-bens/object-transformer-bundle
```
If you're using Symfony Flex, the bundle will be automatically enabled. For older apps, enable it in your Kernel class.

## How to use the Object Transformer Bundle?
The `TransformationMediator` is registered as a service and all implementations of the `TransformerInterface` 
are registered as transformers in the mediator (if they are configured via autoconfiguration). 
Otherwise, the transformers have to be tagged with `itb_object_transformer.transformer`.

The usage of the object transformer is described here: [GitHub - The Object Transformer](https://github.com/it-bens/object-transformer).
